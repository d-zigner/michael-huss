Fulvic acid is not a specific organic molecule, but a family of organic molecules that are organic acids with Nitrogen and Sulfur components. The majority of fulvic acids are classified as carboxyl functional groups but also contains alcohols, amines, ethers, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and benzene rings. The structure of fulvic acid seems to be a polar molecule and not a lipid. The carboxyl groups are the most responsible for releasing hydrogens. The most common way to make alkaline substances for consumption is the addition of baking soda or Sodium bicarbonate. Apparently fulvic acid is extracted from humus, the organic component of soil, so it may be a bit controversial to say that it is extracted from dirt. BLK water claims to make biomolecules more readily available for absorption in the body. In the sources available on their website, there is no mention to the actual benefits of fulvic acid in humans, but there is a paper included about the benefits if provides to plants. The other refences provided are also not from peer reviewed sources, and another discusses the benefits of alkaline diet, but not fulvic acid itself.
